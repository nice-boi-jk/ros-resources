- [urdf_transmission](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/Transmission)
- [ros_control package](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control#Hardware_Interfaces)
- [joint control github wiki](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/wiki) this one seems to be a good guide for 'setting up' control interfaces
whatever that means.
- [roscon 2014 ros_control presentation](https://vimeo.com/107507546), [slides](https://roscon.ros.org/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ros_control_an_overview.pdf)
- [github repo](https://github.com/mindThomas/JetsonCar-Simulation) of a nice robot description. have a look at the nodes in the launch file (in jetsoncar_description) used for joint control.

- Joint control is mainly done using the ros_control package, which is linked above. To be honest, the documentation for this is sparse
like everything else, but atleast the different joint interfaces are explained a bit.
- check the documentations to get a picture. I shall elaborate on the concept once I get a better understanding.
